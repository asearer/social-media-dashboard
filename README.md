# Social Media Analytics Dashboard

## Overview

The **Social Media Analytics Dashboard** is a React-based frontend demo application designed to visualize and analyze social media metrics. The application features interactive charts and a post scheduling interface, providing a comprehensive view of social media performance. The design focuses on a modern and user-friendly interface to facilitate data interaction and visualization.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the **Social Media Analytics Dashboard** is to offer a proof-of-concept for visualizing social media metrics through interactive and responsive charts. This demo is ideal for developers interested in data visualization, frontend development, and integrating modern UI/UX design principles.

- **Data Visualization**: Showcases how to visualize social media metrics using bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.
- **Post Scheduling**: Provides a mechanism for scheduling and managing posts.
- **Interactive UI**: Demonstrates interactive elements such as tooltips and responsive design.

## Features

- **Bar Chart**: Displays social media metrics for different platforms.
- **Post Scheduler**: Schedule and manage posts with date and time selection.
- **Growth Analytics**: Analyze week-over-week, month-over-month, and year-over-year growth with a line chart.
- **Pie Chart**: Visualize performance metrics with a pie chart.
- **Interactive Tooltips**: Hover over chart data points to view detailed values.

## Tech Stack

The **Social Media Analytics Dashboard** is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend Framework**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces and single-page applications.
  
- **Data Visualization**: [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) - A JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations.
  
- **UI Framework**: [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) - A React component library that provides a set of components and styles for building modern UIs.

- **Date Picker**: [react-datepicker](https://reactdatepicker.com/) - A React component for selecting dates and times.

- **CSS Styling**: Custom CSS and inline styles for design consistency and responsive layout.

- **Package Manager**: [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Used for managing project dependencies and scripts.

## Usage

As a frontend demo, the **Social Media Analytics Dashboard** provides an interactive interface where you can:

- **View Social Media Metrics**: The bar chart displays metrics for various social media platforms.
  
- **Schedule Posts**: Use the post scheduler to enter and manage scheduled posts.
  
- **Analyze Growth**: View growth analytics with a line chart showing week-over-week, month-over-month, and year-over-year changes.

- **View Performance Metrics**: The pie chart provides a visual breakdown of performance metrics.

## Important Notes

- **Frontend-Only**: This project is a frontend-only demo and does not include backend logic, data storage, or API integrations. Data is hardcoded for demonstration purposes.

- **Future Enhancements**: The demo can be extended by integrating with backend services, adding user authentication, and connecting to a database for persistent data storage.
